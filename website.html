    <h2>Infrastructure requirements for EV charging stations</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>A transformer and subsequent substation, as well as safety measures, must be installed.</li>
<li>For metering/termination, a 33/11KV cable and supporting equipment should be supplied.</li>
<li>Adequate civil works should be in place.</li>  
<li>There should be enough room for electric vehicles entry and egress as well as charging.</li>  
<li>Any local certifications that may be required. (This varies by state.)
